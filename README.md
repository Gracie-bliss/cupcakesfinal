# cupcakesfinal

Summary: for this assignment I went with the strategy of the first person counts every other person that has entered by counting how many times theres no cupcake. I created a random number generator to pick the people going through, then the first person who is the counter, then the function for all the other guests, which just handles the cupcake being reset or eaten.
Justification: The threads all run as a guest until all guest shave gone through by a while loop and a counter. This was the simplest and most efficient strategyched all 10.
Experimentation: first I tested with a few threads and then more threads until I reached 10.
